# notPlancha's bucket

My bucket with apps that I didn't found in other buckets or in winget or in chocolatey (mostly).

## Add bucket

```pwsh
scoop bucket add notPlancha https://github.com/notPlancha/bucket
# scoop install notPlancha/app
```

## Developing
TODO- Section to be written, here's some notes though

- Make sure to use latest pwsh.
- Scoop currently has an issue which affects my autoupdate (related to checkver) ([#6274](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/pull/6274)), use [my scoop instead](https://github.com/notPlancha/scoop) for development
- check the issues tab
